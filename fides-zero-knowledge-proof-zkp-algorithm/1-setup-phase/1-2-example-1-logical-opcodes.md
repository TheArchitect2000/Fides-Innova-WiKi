 # Example 1 ( for logical opcode "and")

$$Setup(1^{\lambda},s)$$:  This function outputs $$pp=PC.Setup(1^{\lambda},s)$$.&#x20;

If the computation is done in $`\mathbb{F}`$ of order $`p=11`$ and program has $`s=4`$ gate "and", then 

$$KZG.Setup(1^{\lambda},4)=(ck,vk)=$$ (&lcub; $$g\tau^i$$ &rcub; $_{i=0}^{3}$, $$g \tau$$)
 
that for secret element $$\tau=3$$ and generator  $$g=2$$  outputs $$ck=$$ &lcub; $$g\tau^i$$ &rcub; $_{i=0}^{3}$ $$=(2, 6,7,10 )$$ and $$vk=6$$.
